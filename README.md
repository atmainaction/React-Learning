## React Basics

* ReactJS is a JavaScript framework use to create User Interfaces.
* The very basic part of React is an Element.

`
React.createElement(
  'h1',
  {id: 'header', className: 'header'},
  'Hello World'
)
`
* We can create the element using JSX syntax.
* JSX doesnt work in browser, hence we need to transpile it to the JS.
* We can transpile it to using Babel inline scripts, Babael CLI or Webpack.
